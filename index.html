            <h3>Hi, Stranger! Nice to meet you.</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
              I love building things. While difficult engineering problems are often found to be fun to tackle, I get most excited when solving real customer problems that have a business justification. My goals are to continue practice and learning throughout my career and enable my teammates to further succeed in their own careers by utilizing strong collaboration and providing leadership when necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have been coding since I was in middle school, starting with PHP and Python as my two primary languages. Since starting my career within companies, I have found excitement in both the development and the administrative sides of the Agile workflow. My career has led me to learn and develop application in PHP, Python, JavaScript, and Java so far and I am always looking to add more tools to my toolbox.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is a list of technologies and frameworks that I have worked with before either with personal projects or within my employment at companies:
